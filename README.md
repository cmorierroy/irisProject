# About

This is a project to get familiar with basic Python data science tools and get an easy refresher on supervised learning.

It uses the iris dataset and compares the accuracy of 6 different ML algorithms, concludes that SVM is the most accurate one and prints results. Some visualization with matplotlib is also performed.
